    Compute the intersection-over-union similarity (also known as Jaccard similarity)
    of two axis-aligned 2D rectangular boxes or of multiple axis-aligned 2D rectangular
    boxes contained in two arrays with broadcast-compatible shapes.

    Three common use cases would be to compute the similarities for 1 vs. 1, 1 vs. `n`,
    or `n` vs. `n` boxes. The two arguments are symmetric.

    Arguments:
        boxes1 (array): Either a 1D Numpy array of shape `(4, )` containing the coordinates for one box in the
            format specified by `coords` or a 2D Numpy array of shape `(n, 4)` containing the coordinates for `n` boxes.
            Shape must be broadcast-compatible to `boxes2`.
        boxes2 (array): Either a 1D Numpy array of shape `(4, )` containing the coordinates for one box in the
            format specified by `coords` or a 2D Numpy array of shape `(n, 4)` containing the coordinates for `n` boxes.
            Shape must be broadcast-compatible to `boxes1`.
        coords (str, optional): The coordinate format in the input arrays. Can be either 'centroids' for the format
            `(cx, cy, w, h)` or 'minmax' for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.

    Returns:
        A 1D Numpy array of dtype float containing values in [0,1], the Jaccard similarity of the boxes in `boxes1` and `boxes2`.
        0 means there is no overlap between two given boxes, 1 means their coordinates are identical.

    Convert coordinates for axis-aligned 2D boxes between two coordinate formats.

    Creates a copy of `tensor`, i.e. does not operate in place. Currently there are

def greedy_nms(y_pred_decoded, iou_threshold=0.45, coords='minmax'):
    '''
    Perform greedy non-maximum suppression on the input boxes.

    Greedy NMS works by selecting the box with the highest score and
    removing all boxes around it that are too close to it measured by IoU-similarity.
    Out of the boxes that are left over, once again the one with the highest
    score is selected and so on, until no boxes with too much overlap are left.

    This is a basic, straight-forward NMS algorithm that is relatively efficient,
    but it has a number of downsides. One of those downsides is that the box with
    the highest score might not always be the box with the best fit to the object.
    There are more sophisticated NMS techniques like [this one](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/506283/1/3924_postprint.pdf)
    that use a combination of nearby boxes, but in general there will probably
    always be a trade-off between speed and quality for any given NMS technique.

    Arguments:
        y_pred_decoded (list): A batch of decoded predictions. For a given batch size `n` this
            is a list of length `n` where each list element is a 2D Numpy array.
            For a batch item with `k` predicted boxes this 2D Numpy array has
            shape `(k, 6)`, where each row contains the coordinates of the respective
            box in the format `[class_id, score, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.
            Technically, the number of columns doesn't have to be 6, it can be
            arbitrary as long as the first four elements of each row are
            `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax` (in this order) and the last element
            is the score assigned to the prediction. Note that this function is
            agnostic to the scale of the score or what it represents.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of
            greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score.
            Defaults to 0.45 following the paper.
        coords (str, optional): The coordinate format of `y_pred_decoded`.
            Can be one of the formats supported by `iou()`. Defaults to 'minmax'.

    Returns:
        The predictions after removing non-maxima. The format is the same as the input format.

    Convert model prediction output back to a format that contains only the positive box predictions
    (i.e. the same format that `enconde_y()` takes as input).

    After the decoding, two stages of prediction filtering are performed for each class individually:
    First confidence thresholding, then greedy non-maximum suppression. The filtering results for all
    classes are concatenated and the `top_k` overall highest confidence results constitute the final
    predictions for a given batch item. This procedure follows the original Caffe implementation.
    For a slightly different and more efficient alternative to decode raw model output that performs
    non-maximum suppresion globally instead of per class, see `decode_y2()` below.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in a specific
            positive class in order to be considered for the non-maximum suppression stage for the respective class.
            A lower value will result in a larger part of the selection process being done by the non-maximum suppression
            stage, while a larger value will result in a larger part of the selection process happening in the confidence
            thresholding stage. Defaults to 0.01, following the paper.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): A float in [0,1]. All boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold`
            with a locally maximal box will be removed from the set of predictions for a given class, where 'maximal' refers
            to the box score. Defaults to 0.45 following the paper.
        top_k (int, optional): The number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item after the
            non-maximum suppression stage. Defaults to 200, following the paper.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax'
            for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`. Defaults to `False`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.

    Returns:
        A python list of length `batch_size` where each list element represents the predicted boxes
        for one image and contains a Numpy array of shape `(boxes, 6)` where each row is a box prediction for
        a non-background class for the respective image in the format `[class_id, confidence, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.

    (i.e. the same format that `enconde_y()` takes as input).

    Optionally performs confidence thresholding and greedy non-maximum suppression afte the decoding stage.

    Note that the decoding procedure used here is not the same as the procedure used in the original Caffe implementation.
    The procedure used here assigns every box its highest confidence as the class and then removes all boxes fro which
    the highest confidence is the background class. This results in less work for the subsequent non-maximum suppression,
    because the vast majority of the predictions will be filtered out just by the fact that their highest confidence is
    for the background class. It is much more efficient than the procedure of the original implementation, but the
    results may also differ.

    Arguments:
        y_pred (array): The prediction output of the SSD model, expected to be a Numpy array
            of shape `(batch_size, #boxes, #classes + 4 + 4 + 4)`, where `#boxes` is the total number of
            boxes predicted by the model per image and the last axis contains
            `[one-hot vector for the classes, 4 predicted coordinate offsets, 4 anchor box coordinates, 4 variances]`.
        confidence_thresh (float, optional): A float in [0,1), the minimum classification confidence in any positive
            class required for a given box to be considered a positive prediction. A lower value will result
            in better recall, while a higher value will result in better precision. Do not use this parameter with the
            goal to combat the inevitably many duplicates that an SSD will produce, the subsequent non-maximum suppression
            stage will take care of those. Defaults to 0.5.
        iou_threshold (float, optional): `None` or a float in [0,1]. If `None`, no non-maximum suppression will be
            performed. If not `None`, greedy NMS will be performed after the confidence thresholding stage, meaning
            all boxes with a Jaccard similarity of greater than `iou_threshold` with a locally maximal box will be removed
            from the set of predictions, where 'maximal' refers to the box score. Defaults to 0.45.
        top_k (int, optional): 'all' or an integer with number of highest scoring predictions to be kept for each batch item
            after the non-maximum suppression stage. Defaults to 'all', in which case all predictions left after the NMS stage
            will be kept.
        input_coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format that the model outputs. Can be either 'centroids'
            for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width, and height) or 'minmax'
            for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
        normalize_coords (bool, optional): Set to `True` if the model outputs relative coordinates (i.e. coordinates in [0,1])
            and you wish to transform these relative coordinates back to absolute coordinates. If the model outputs
            relative coordinates, but you do not want to convert them back to absolute coordinates, set this to `False`.
            Do not set this to `True` if the model already outputs absolute coordinates, as that would result in incorrect
            coordinates. Requires `img_height` and `img_width` if set to `True`. Defaults to `False`.
        img_height (int, optional): The height of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.
        img_width (int, optional): The width of the input images. Only needed if `normalize_coords` is `True`.

    Returns:
        A python list of length `batch_size` where each list element represents the predicted boxes
        for one image and contains a Numpy array of shape `(boxes, 6)` where each row is a box prediction for
        a non-background class for the respective image in the format `[class_id, confidence, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]`.

            n_classes (int): The number of classes including the background class.
            predictor_sizes (list): A list of int-tuples of the format `(height, width)`
                containing the output heights and widths of the convolutional predictor layers.
            min_scale (float, optional): The smallest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. Defaults to 0.1.
            max_scale (float, optional): The largest scaling factor for the size of the anchor boxes as a fraction
                of the shorter side of the input images. All scaling factors between the smallest and the
                largest will be linearly interpolated. Note that the second to last of the linearly interpolated
                scaling factors will actually be the scaling factor for the last predictor layer, while the last
                scaling factor is used for the second box for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer
                if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. Defaults to 0.9.
            scales (list, optional): A list of floats containing scaling factors per convolutional predictor layer.
                This list must be one element longer than the number of predictor layers. The first `k` elements are the
                scaling factors for the `k` predictor layers, while the last element is used for the second box
                for aspect ratio 1 in the last predictor layer if `two_boxes_for_ar1` is `True`. This additional
                last scaling factor must be passed either way, even if it is not being used.
                Defaults to `None`. If a list is passed, this argument overrides `min_scale` and
                `max_scale`. All scaling factors must be greater than zero.
            aspect_ratios_global (list, optional): The list of aspect ratios for which anchor boxes are to be
                generated. This list is valid for all prediction layers. Defaults to [0.5, 1.0, 2.0].
            aspect_ratios_per_layer (list, optional): A list containing one aspect ratio list for each prediction layer.
                If a list is passed, it overrides `aspect_ratios_global`. Defaults to `None`.
            two_boxes_for_ar1 (bool, optional): Only relevant for aspect ratios lists that contain 1. Will be ignored otherwise.
                If `True`, two anchor boxes will be generated for aspect ratio 1. The first will be generated
                using the scaling factor for the respective layer, the second one will be generated using
                geometric mean of said scaling factor and next bigger scaling factor.
            limit_boxes (bool, optional): If `True`, limits box coordinates to stay within image boundaries.
                Defaults to `True`.
            variances (list, optional): A list of 4 floats >0 with scaling factors (actually it's not factors but divisors
                to be precise) for the encoded ground truth (i.e. target) box coordinates. A variance value of 1.0 would apply
                no scaling at all to the targets, while values in (0,1) upscale the encoded targets and values greater than 1.0
                downscale the encoded targets. If you want to reproduce the configuration of the original SSD,
                set this to `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`, provided the coordinate format is 'centroids'. Defaults to `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]`.
            pos_iou_threshold (float, optional): The intersection-over-union similarity threshold that must be
                met in order to match a given ground truth box to a given anchor box. Defaults to 0.5.
            neg_iou_threshold (float, optional): The maximum allowed intersection-over-union similarity of an
                anchor box with any ground truth box to be labeled a negative (i.e. background) box. If an
                anchor box is neither a positive, nor a negative box, it will be ignored during training.
            coords (str, optional): The box coordinate format to be used internally in the model (i.e. this is not the input format
                of the ground truth labels). Can be either 'centroids' for the format `(cx, cy, w, h)` (box center coordinates, width,
                and height) or 'minmax' for the format `(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`. Defaults to 'centroids'.
            normalize_coords (bool, optional): If `True`, the encoder uses relative instead of absolute coordinates.
                This means instead of using absolute tartget coordinates, the encoder will scale all coordinates to be within [0,1].
                This way learning becomes independent of the input image size. Defaults to `False`.
