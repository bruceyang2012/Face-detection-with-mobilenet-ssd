# Face-detection-with-mobilenet-ssd
This is a implemetation of mobile-ssd for face detection written by keras.

## prepare data
Download Wider Face data from Official Website , and put it into face_data folder in face_generator.py.

## train
Follow face_train.ipynb step by step. You can change the parameters for better performance.

## test
Here are some testing results. It seems good but lots of improvement is needed.
